    <p style="max-width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 2em;">InsightBlog is a fictional blog conveived for the purpose of learning PHP. First developed around August 23 2024 by Mateo. This website was made with PHP and a little bit of javascripts, with mySQL being its database.
        Currently thinking about making a new project after I finish with this one.
